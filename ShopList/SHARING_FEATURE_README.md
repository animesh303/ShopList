- Efficient CSV file creation
- Minimal memory footprint

## Testing

The sharing functionality includes comprehensive tests covering:

- Text content generation
- CSV content generation
- Share state management
- Multiple item formats
- Edge cases (empty lists, special characters, etc.)

Run tests with:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme ShopList -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Sharing Templates**: User-defined sharing formats
2. **QR Code Generation**: For quick list sharing
3. **Collaborative Lists**: Real-time sharing with other users
4. **Export Formats**: PDF, JSON, XML support
5. **Scheduled Sharing**: Automatic sharing at specific times
6. **Integration APIs**: Direct integration with grocery delivery services

## Privacy & Security

- User maintains full control over what and how to share
- Temporary files are cleaned up automatically
- No tracking or analytics on sharing behavior
